# Prism-Insurance-BI-Report
This project is an insurance dashboard created in Power BI. Data was first cleaned in MS SQL Server and then imported into Power BI. Key insights like claim amount by age, policy status, and premium by policy type were visualized with filters for easy analysis.

# Project Objective:
To analyze insurance data and provide key insights into policy status, claim trends, and premium distribution using an interactive Power BI dashboard for better decision-making.
